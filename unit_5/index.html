		<h2>Client List</h2>
		<h3>Key Programs - Web Design and Maintenance</h3>
		<p>I have redesigned much of the Key Executive Leadership Programs' website after coming on board full time in late 2018. The goal of the redesign was to make the website more dynamic, visually compelling and increase user engagement. I have also been able to siginificantly reduce the number of pages on the site to decrease load time and ensure users find what they need right away without getting lost.</p>
